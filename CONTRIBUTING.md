# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Quick notes

- AI-assisted commits are welcome as long as tests are included.
- I may edit your pull request to improve clarity or presentation.
- Do not worry about linters or formatting; I will handle those.

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repo and create a branch.
2. Make your changes.
3. Run tests if possible and include the results in your PR.
4. Open a pull request with a short, clear description.

If you are unsure about anything, open an issue or draft PR and we will figure it out together.
